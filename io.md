# IO and sorting (WIP)

**[You can find all the code for this chapter here](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests/tree/master/io)**

[In the previous chapter](json.md) we continued iterating on our application by adding a new endpoint `/league`. Along the way we learned about how to deal with JSON, embedding types and routing.

Our product-owner is somewhat perturbed by the software losing the scores when the server was restarted. This is because our implementation of our store is in-memory. She is also not pleased that we didn't interpret the `/league` endpoint should return the players ordered by number of wins!

## The code so far

```go
// server.go
package main

import (
	"encoding/json"
	"fmt"
	"net/http"
)

// PlayerStore stores score information about players
type PlayerStore interface {
	GetPlayerScore(name string) int
	RecordWin(name string)
	GetLeague() []Player
}

// Player stores a name with a number of wins
type Player struct {
	Name string
	Wins int
}

// PlayerServer is a HTTP interface for player information
type PlayerServer struct {
	store PlayerStore
	http.Handler
}

const jsonContentType = "application/json"

// NewPlayerServer creates a PlayerServer with routing configured
func NewPlayerServer(store PlayerStore) *PlayerServer {
	p := new(PlayerServer)

	p.store = store

	router := http.NewServeMux()
	router.Handle("/league", http.HandlerFunc(p.leagueHandler))
	router.Handle("/players/", http.HandlerFunc(p.playersHandler))

	p.Handler = router

	return p
}

func (p *PlayerServer) leagueHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	json.NewEncoder(w).Encode(p.store.GetLeague())
	w.Header().Set("content-type", jsonContentType)
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusOK)
}

func (p *PlayerServer) playersHandler(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	player := r.URL.Path[len("/players/"):]

	switch r.Method {
	case http.MethodPost:
		p.processWin(w, player)
	case http.MethodGet:
		p.showScore(w, player)
	}
}

func (p *PlayerServer) showScore(w http.ResponseWriter, player string) {
	score := p.store.GetPlayerScore(player)

	if score == 0 {
		w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)
	}

	fmt.Fprint(w, score)
}

func (p *PlayerServer) processWin(w http.ResponseWriter, player string) {
	p.store.RecordWin(player)
	w.WriteHeader(http.StatusAccepted)
}
```

```go
// InMemoryPlayerStore.go
package main

func NewInMemoryPlayerStore() *InMemoryPlayerStore {
	return &InMemoryPlayerStore{map[string]int{}}
}

type InMemoryPlayerStore struct {
	store map[string]int
}

func (i *InMemoryPlayerStore) GetLeague() []Player {
	var league []Player
	for name, wins := range i.store {
		league = append(league, Player{name, wins})
	}
	return league
}

func (i *InMemoryPlayerStore) RecordWin(name string) {
	i.store[name]++
}

func (i *InMemoryPlayerStore) GetPlayerScore(name string) int {
	return i.store[name]
}
```

```go
// main.go
package main

import (
	"log"
	"net/http"
)

func main() {
	server := NewPlayerServer(NewInMemoryPlayerStore())

	if err := http.ListenAndServe(":5000", server); err != nil {
		log.Fatalf("could not listen on port 5000 %v", err)
	}
}
```

You can find the corresponding tests in the link at the top of the chapter.

## Store the data

There are dozens of databases we could use for this but we're going to go for a very simple approach. We're going to store the data for this application in a file as JSON.

This keeps the data very portable and is relatively simple to implement.

It wont scale especially well but given this is a prototype it'll be fine for now. If our circumstances change and it's no longer appropriate it'll be simple to swap it out for something different because of the `PlayerStore` abstraction we have used.

We will keep the `InMemoryPlayerStore` for now so that the integration tests keep passing as we develop our new store. Once we are confident our new implementation is sufficient to make the integration test pass we will swap it in and then delete `InMemoryPlayerStore`.

## Write the test first

By now you should be familiar with the interfaces around the standard library for reading data (`io.Reader`), writing data (`io.Writer`) and how we can use the standard library to test these functions without having to use real files.

For this work to be complete we'll need to implement `PlayerStore` so we'll write tests for our store calling the methods we need to implement. We'll start with `GetLeague`.

```go
func TestFileSystemStore(t *testing.T) {

	t.Run("/league from a reader", func(t *testing.T) {
		database := strings.NewReader(`[
			{"Name": "Cleo", "Wins": 10},
			{"Name": "Chris", "Wins": 33}]`)

		store := FileSystemStore{database}

		got := store.GetLeague()

		want := []Player{
			{"Cleo", 10},
			{"Chris", 33},
		}

		assertLeague(t, got, want)
	})
}
```

We're using `strings.NewReader` which will return us a `Reader`, which is what our `FileSystemStore` will use to read data. In `main` we will open a file, which is also a `Reader`.

## Try to run the test

```
# github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests/json-and-io/v7
./FileSystemStore_test.go:15:12: undefined: FileSystemStore
```

## Write the minimal amount of code for the test to run and check the failing test output

Let's define `FileSystemStore` in a new file

```go
type FileSystemStore struct {}
```

Try again

```
# github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests/json-and-io/v7
./FileSystemStore_test.go:15:28: too many values in struct initializer
./FileSystemStore_test.go:17:15: store.GetLeague undefined (type FileSystemStore has no field or method GetLeague)
```

It's complaining because we're passing in a `Reader` but not expecting one and it doesnt have `GetLeague` defined yet.

```go
type FileSystemStore struct {
	database io.Reader
}

func (f *FileSystemStore) GetLeague() []Player {
	return nil
}
```

One more try...

```
=== RUN   TestFileSystemStore//league_from_a_reader
    --- FAIL: TestFileSystemStore//league_from_a_reader (0.00s)
    	FileSystemStore_test.go:24: got [] want [{Cleo 10} {Chris 33}]
```

## Write enough code to make it pass

We've read JSON from a reader before

```go
func (f *FileSystemStore) GetLeague() []Player {
	var league []Player
	json.NewDecoder(f.database).Decode(&league)
	return league
}
```

The test should pass.

## Refactor

We _have_ done this before! Our test code for the server had to decode the JSON from the response.

Let's try DRYing this up into a function.

Create a new file called `league.go` and put this inside.

```go
func NewLeague(rdr io.Reader) ([]Player, error) {
	var league []Player
	err := json.NewDecoder(rdr).Decode(&league)
	return league, err
}
```

Call this in our implementation and in our test helper `getLeagueFromResponse` in `server_test.go`

```go
func (f *FileSystemStore) GetLeague() []Player {
	league, _ := NewLeague(f.database)
	return league
}
```

We haven't got a strategy yet for dealing with parsing errors but let's press on.

### Seeking problems

There is a flaw in our implementation. First of all let's remind ourselves how `io.Reader` is defined.

```go
type Reader interface {
        Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```

With our file you can imagine it reading through byte by byte until the end. What happens if you try and `Read` a second time?

Add the following to the end of our current test.

```go
// read again
got = store.GetLeague()
assertLeague(t, got, want)
```

We want this to pass, but if you run the test it doesn't.

The problem is our `Reader` has reached to the end so there is nothing more to read. We need a way to tell it to go back to the start.

[ReadSeeker](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#ReadSeeker) is another interface in the standard library that can help.

```go
type ReadSeeker interface {
        Reader
        Seeker
}
```

Remember embedding? This is an interface comprised of `Reader` and [`Seeker`](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Seeker)

```go
type Seeker interface {
        Seek(offset int64, whence int) (int64, error)
}
```

This sounds good, can we change `FileSystemStore` to take this interface instead?

```go
type FileSystemStore struct {
	database io.ReadSeeker
}

func (f *FileSystemStore) GetLeague() []Player {
	f.database.Seek(0, 0)
	league, _ := NewLeague(f.database)
	return league
}
```

Try running the test, it now passes! Happily for us `string.NewReader` that we used in our test also implements `ReadSeeker` so we didn't have to make any other changes.

Next we'll implement `GetPlayerScore`

## Write the test first

```go
t.Run("get player score", func(t *testing.T) {
    database := strings.NewReader(`[
        {"Name": "Cleo", "Wins": 10},
        {"Name": "Chris", "Wins": 33}]`)

    store := FileSystemPlayerStore{database}

    got := store.GetPlayerScore("Chris")

    want := 33

    if got != want {
        t.Errorf("got %d want %d", got, want)
    }
})
```

## Try to run the test

`./FileSystemStore_test.go:38:15: store.GetPlayerScore undefined (type FileSystemPlayerStore has no field or method GetPlayerScore)`

## Write the minimal amount of code for the test to run and check the failing test output

We need to add the method to our new type to get the test to compile.

```go
func (f *FileSystemPlayerStore) GetPlayerScore(name string) int {
	return 0
}
```

Now it compiles and the test fails

```
=== RUN   TestFileSystemStore/get_player_score
    --- FAIL: TestFileSystemStore//get_player_score (0.00s)
    	FileSystemStore_test.go:43: got 0 want 33
```

## Write enough code to make it pass

We can iterate over the league to find the player and return their score

```go
func (f *FileSystemPlayerStore) GetPlayerScore(name string) int {

	var wins int

	for _, player := range f.GetLeague() {
		if player.Name == name {
			wins = player.Wins
			break
		}
	}

	return wins
}
```

## Refactor

You will have seen dozens of test helper refactorings so I'll leave this to you to make it work

```go
t.Run("/get player score", func(t *testing.T) {
    database := strings.NewReader(`[
        {"Name": "Cleo", "Wins": 10},
        {"Name": "Chris", "Wins": 33}]`)

    store := FileSystemPlayerStore{database}

    got := store.GetPlayerScore("Chris")
    want := 33
    assertScoreEquals(t, got, want)
})
```

Finally we need to start recording scores with `RecordWin`

## Write the test first

Our approach is fairly short-sighted for writes. We cant (easily) just update one "row" of JSON in a file. We'll need to store the _whole_ new representation of our database on every write.

How do we write? We'd normally use a `Writer` but we already have our `ReadSeeker`. Potentially we could have two dependencies but the standard library already has an interface for us `ReadWriteSeeker` which lets us do all the things we'll need to do with a file.

Let's update our type

```go
type FileSystemPlayerStore struct {
	database io.ReadWriteSeeker
}
```

See if it compiles

```go
./FileSystemStore_test.go:15:34: cannot use database (type *strings.Reader) as type io.ReadWriteSeeker in field value:
	*strings.Reader does not implement io.ReadWriteSeeker (missing Write method)
./FileSystemStore_test.go:36:34: cannot use database (type *strings.Reader) as type io.ReadWriteSeeker in field value:
	*strings.Reader does not implement io.ReadWriteSeeker (missing Write method)
```

It's not too surprising that `strings.Reader` does not implement `ReadWriteSeeker` so what do we do?

We have two choices

- We create a temporary file for each test. `*os.File` implements `ReadWriteSeeker`. The pro of this is it becomes more of an integration test, we're really reading and writing from the file system so it will give us a very high level of confidence. The cons are we prefer unit tests because they are faster and generally simpler. We will also need to do more work around creating temporary files and then making sure they're removed after the test.
- We could use a third party library. [github.com/mattetti](Mattetti) has written a library [filebuffer](https://github.com/mattetti/filebuffer) which implements the interface we need and doesn't touch the file system.

I don't think there's an especially wrong answer here, but by choosing to use a third party library I would have to explain dependency management! So we will use files instead.

Before adding our test we need to make our other tests compile by replacing the `strings.Reader` with an `os.File`.

Let's create a helper function which will create a temporary file with some data inside it

```go
func createTempFile(t *testing.T, initialData string) *os.File {
	t.Helper()

	tmpfile, err := ioutil.TempFile("", "db")

	if err != nil {
		t.Fatalf("could not create temp file %v", err)
	}

	tmpfile.Write([]byte(initialData))
	return tmpfile
}
```

[TempFile](https://golang.org/pkg/io/ioutil/#TempDir) creates a temporary file for us to use. The `"db"` value we've passed in is a prefix put on a random file name it will create. This is to ensure it wont clash with other files by accident.

Now we can fix our two tests

```go
func TestFileSystemStore(t *testing.T) {

	t.Run("league from a reader", func(t *testing.T) {
		database := createTempFile(t, `[
			{"Name": "Cleo", "Wins": 10},
			{"Name": "Chris", "Wins": 33}]`)
		defer os.Remove(database.Name())

		store := FileSystemPlayerStore{database}

		got := store.GetLeague()

		want := []Player{
			{"Cleo", 10},
			{"Chris", 33},
		}

		assertLeague(t, got, want)

		// read again
		got = store.GetLeague()
		assertLeague(t, got, want)
	})

	t.Run("get player score", func(t *testing.T) {
		database := createTempFile(t, `[
			{"Name": "Cleo", "Wins": 10},
			{"Name": "Chris", "Wins": 33}]`)
		defer os.Remove(database.Name())

		store := FileSystemPlayerStore{database}

		got := store.GetPlayerScore("Chris")
		want := 33
		assertScoreEquals(t, got, want)
	})
}
```

Run the tests and they should be passing! That was a fair amount of changes but now it feels like we have our interface definition complete and it should be very easy to add new tests from now.

Let's get the first iteration of recording a win for an existing player

```go
t.Run("store wins for existing players", func(t *testing.T) {
    database := createTempFile(t, `[
        {"Name": "Cleo", "Wins": 10},
        {"Name": "Chris", "Wins": 33}]`)
    defer os.Remove(database.Name())

    store := FileSystemPlayerStore{database}

    store.RecordWin("Chris")

    got := store.GetPlayerScore("Chris")
    want := 34
    assertScoreEquals(t, got, want)
})
```

## Try to run the test
`./FileSystemStore_test.go:67:8: store.RecordWin undefined (type FileSystemPlayerStore has no field or method RecordWin)`

## Write the minimal amount of code for the test to run and check the failing test output

Add the new method

```go
func (f *FileSystemPlayerStore) RecordWin(name string) {

}
```

```
=== RUN   TestFileSystemStore/store_wins_for_existing_players
    --- FAIL: TestFileSystemStore/store_wins_for_existing_players (0.00s)
    	FileSystemStore_test.go:71: got 33 want 34
```

Our implementation is empty so the old score is getting returned

## Write enough code to make it pass

```go
func (f *FileSystemPlayerStore) RecordWin(name string) {
	league := f.GetLeague()

	for i, player := range league {
		if player.Name == name {
			league[i].Wins++
		}
	}

	f.database.Seek(0,0)
	json.NewEncoder(f.database).Encode(league)
}
```

You may be asking yourself why I am doing `league[i].Wins++` rather than `player.Wins++`.

When you `range` over a slice you are returned the current index of the loop (in our case `i`) and a _copy_ of the element at that index. Changing the `Wins` value of a copy wont have any effect on the `league` slice that we iterate on. For that reason we need to get the reference to the actual value by doing `league[i]` and then changing that value instead.

If you run the tests, they should now be passing.

## Refactor

In `GetPlayerScore` and `RecordWin` we are iterating over `[]Player` to find a player by name.

We could refactor this common code in the internals of `FileSystemStore` but to me it feels like this is maybe useful code we can lift into a new type. Working with a "League" so far has always been with `[]Player` but we can create a new type called `League`. This will be easier for other developers to understand and then we can attach useful methods onto that type for us to use.

Inside `league.go` add the following

```go
type League []Player

func (l League) Find(name string) *Player {
	for i, p := range l {
		if p.Name==name {
			return &l[i]
		}
	}
	return nil
}
```

Now if anyone has a `League` they can easily find a given player.

And change our `PlayerStore` interface to return `League` rather than `[]Player`. Try and re-run the tests, you'll get a compilation problem because we've changed the interface but it's very easy to fix; just change the return type from `[]Player` to `League`.

This lets us simplify our methods in `FileSystemStore`.

```go
func (f *FileSystemPlayerStore) GetPlayerScore(name string) int {

	player := f.GetLeague().Find(name)

	if player != nil {
		return player.Wins
	}

	return 0
}

func (f *FileSystemPlayerStore) RecordWin(name string) {
	league := f.GetLeague()
	player := league.Find(name)

	if player != nil {
		player.Wins++
	}

	f.database.Seek(0, 0)
	json.NewEncoder(f.database).Encode(league)
}
```

This is looking much better and we can see how we might be able to find other useful functionality around `League` can be refactored.

We now need to handle the scenario of recording wins of new players.

## Write the test first
```go
t.Run("store wins for existing players", func(t *testing.T) {
    database := createTempFile(t, `[
        {"Name": "Cleo", "Wins": 10},
        {"Name": "Chris", "Wins": 33}]`)
    defer os.Remove(database.Name())

    store := FileSystemPlayerStore{database}

    store.RecordWin("Pepper")

    got := store.GetPlayerScore("Pepper")
    want := 1
    assertScoreEquals(t, got, want)
})
```
## Try to run the test

```
=== RUN   TestFileSystemStore/store_wins_for_existing_players#01
    --- FAIL: TestFileSystemStore/store_wins_for_existing_players#01 (0.00s)
    	FileSystemStore_test.go:86: got 0 want 1
```
## Write enough code to make it pass

We just need to handle the scenario where `Find` returns `nil` because it couldn't find the player.

```go
func (f *FileSystemPlayerStore) RecordWin(name string) {
	league := f.GetLeague()
	player := league.Find(name)

	if player != nil {
		player.Wins++
	} else {
		league = append(league, Player{name, 1})
	}

	f.database.Seek(0, 0)
	json.NewEncoder(f.database).Encode(league)
}
```

## Wrapping up

What we've covered:

- The `Seeker` interface and its relation with `Reader` and `Writer`
- Working with files
