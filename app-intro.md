# Build an application

Now that you have hopefully digested the _Go Fundamentals_ section you have a solid grounding of a majority of Go's language features and how to write TDD. 

This next section will involve building an application. 

Each chapter will iterate on the previous one, expanding the applications functionality as our product owner dictates. 

New concepts will be introduced to help facilitate writing great code but most of the new material will be learning what can be accomplished from Go's standard library.

- [HTTP server](http-server.md) - We will create an application which listens to HTTP requests and responds to them.
- [JSON](json.md) - We will make our endpoints return JSON and explore how to do routing.
- [IO](io.md) - We will persist and read our data from disk and we'll cover sorting data.
