# Maps

**[You can find all the code for this chapter
here](https://github.com/quii/learn-go-with-tests/tree/master/maps)**

In the previous chapter, you saw how to store values in order. Now, we will
look at a way to store items by a `key` and look them up quickly.

Maps allow you to store items in a manner similar to a dictionary. You can
think of the `key` as the word and the `value` as the definition. And what better
way is there to learn about Maps than to build our own dictionary?
